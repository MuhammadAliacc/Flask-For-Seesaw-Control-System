# Flask-For-Seesaw-Control-System

This repository is dedicated to the seesaw hardware system designed to maintain a ball at a specified setpoint. It includes the necessary files to set up a Flask server for communication with another PC on the same network, where Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents and PID controllers are running.

Key Features:
A Flask server to send and receive data between the seesaw hardware and the control PC.
A user-friendly webpage for:
Setting manual beam angle values.
Displaying real-time data fetched from the server.
Providing user instructions for seamless operation.
Link to the RL Repository
The RL agent and PID controllers used for controlling the ball position can be found here:
